# PAINT
A Web Browser Paint Tool 

## 🎨 Paint Project
Welcome to my Paint project! 
<br> This application lets users express their creativity by doodling directly in the browser.
<br> Whether you're a professional artist or just doodling for fun, this tool is for you!

## 🛠️ Features
- Brush Tools: Choose the size to create your masterpiece! 🖌️
- Brush defaults to the second size step for quick access.
- Size slider uses 10 steps and the eraser defaults to twice the brush size.
- Color Palette: Pick your favorite colors 🌈
- Eraser Tool: Remove paint strokes without affecting imported images. ❌
- Smooth brush rendering for better performance.
- Undo and redo buttons with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y).
- "New" option clears the canvas (Ctrl+N) via the File menu.
- New canvas resets the size to the maximum space available.
- Browser shortcut for Ctrl+N is overridden so it clears the canvas instead of opening a new window.
- Save Your Artwork: Download your creations as images to share with friends. 💾
- Modern interface with improved toolbar styling.
- Continue drawing even if the cursor leaves the canvas.
- Paste images with `Ctrl + V` to fill the canvas.
- Copy your art to the clipboard with `Ctrl + C` or the Copy button.
- Toggle Dark Mode with a persistent setting.
- Imported or pasted images scale to fit while keeping their aspect ratio.
- Importing or pasting starts a new canvas first so repeated images don't shrink it.
- Exports and copied images include the current background color.
- Rounded canvas container resizes to match imported images.
- Resize handles in the top-left and bottom-right corners crop the canvas from those sides and realign afterwards.
- File dropdown groups Import, Export, Copy and New options.
- Tailwind CSS styling for a modern look.
- Dark mode toggle button shows a moon in dark mode and a sun in light mode, remembering your choice.
- Easy-to-edit color palette using CSS variables at the top of `style.css`.
- Bucket tool fills areas with the current color (shortcut `G`), and the size slider controls its color tolerance.
- Tool buttons use emojis, including 🖌️ for the brush, 🧽 for the eraser and 🪣 for the bucket.
- Hold Shift and click to draw a straight line from your last brush point.

## 🖼️ Snip to Paint

The `snip_to_paint.py` script listens for the **Win+Shift+S** shortcut. When triggered it launches the Windows snipping UI, waits for an image to appear on the clipboard and then opens the paint page in your default browser. The captured image is automatically pasted onto the canvas.

### Running

```bash
pip install keyboard pyautogui pywin32
python snip_to_paint.py
```

Leave the script running in the background. After you select a screen area, a new browser tab opens with the paint app and the screenshot is pasted.
