# PAINT
A Web Browser Paint Tool 

## 🎨 Paint Project
Welcome to my Paint project! 
<br> This application lets users express their creativity by doodling directly in the browser.
<br> Whether you're a professional artist or just doodling for fun, this tool is for you!

## 🛠️ Features
- Brush Tools: Choose the size to create your masterpiece! 🖌️
- Brush defaults to the second size step for quick access.
- Size slider uses 10 steps and the eraser defaults to twice the brush size.
- Color Palette: Pick your favorite colors 🌈
- Eraser Tool: Remove paint strokes without affecting imported images. ❌
- Smooth brush rendering for better performance.
- Undo and redo buttons with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y).
- "New" option clears the canvas (Ctrl+N) via the File menu.
- Browser shortcut for Ctrl+N is overridden so it clears the canvas instead of opening a new window.

- Toggle Dark Mode with a persistent setting.
- Imported or pasted images scale to fit while keeping their aspect ratio.
- Exports and copied images include the current background color.
- Rounded canvas container resizes to match imported images.
- Resize handles in the top-left and bottom-right corners crop the canvas from those sides and realign afterwards.
- File dropdown groups Import, Export, Copy and New options.
- Tailwind CSS styling for a modern look.
- Dark mode toggle button shows a moon in dark mode and a sun in light mode, remembering your choice.
- Easy-to-edit color palette using CSS variables at the top of `style.css`.
- Bucket tool fills areas with the current color (shortcut `G`), and the size slider controls its color tolerance.
