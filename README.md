# PAINT
A Web Browser Paint Tool 

## üé® Paint Project
Welcome to my Paint project! 
<br> This application lets users express their creativity by doodling directly in the browser.
<br> Whether you're a professional artist or just doodling for fun, this tool is for you!

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Brush Tools: Choose the size to create your masterpiece! ‚úçÔ∏è
- Brush defaults to the second size step for quick access.
- Size slider uses 10 steps and the eraser defaults to twice the brush size.
- Color Palette: Pick your favorite colors üåà
- Eraser Tool: Remove paint strokes without affecting imported images. ‚ùå
- Smooth brush rendering for better performance.
- Undo and redo buttons with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y).
